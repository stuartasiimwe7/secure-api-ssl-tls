# Secure API with SSL/TLS

This project demonstrates how to set up a secure API using Flask and SSL/TLS encryption. By encrypting data transmission, we ensure secure communication between clients and servers. This is a fundamental skill in system security and is widely applicable to embedded systems, IoT devices, and web applications.

## Features
- A simple API built with Flask that responds with a message.
- SSL/TLS encryption enabled for secure communication.
- Self-signed SSL certificates for local testing and learning.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For building the API using Flask.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for building the API.
- **OpenSSL**: For generating SSL/TLS certificates.
- **Git**: For version control and project hosting.
